# SECTION: Notes
Take `q.uiver`'s suggested `height`s and scale them by `0.7` on the `<iframe>` you try to embed.


# TODO LIST:
`discussion/whatever.html`:
  [ ] Make contents bar a "show" button when too small
  [ ] Make contents bar a hamburger when too small
  [ ] Make sidenotes appear as a pop up on tapping the link when too small
    ^^ like wikipedia hovering over internal links
  [ ] Change the main content to an `<article>` (current `<div>`).
