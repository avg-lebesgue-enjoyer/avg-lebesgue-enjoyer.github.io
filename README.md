# TODO LIST:

Missing content:
  - [ ] More Discussion-family pages
  - [ ] More Proof-family pages

Defo fix:
  - Glossary:
    - [ ] `glossary.js` has a "FIXME:" comment
  - Discussion- and Proof-family pages:
    - [ ] Make `<iframe>`s not terrible on screen sizes other than my own...
    - [ ] **Redesign where necessary for mobile.**
        - ^^ a decent chunk is necessary...
        - [ ] E.g. text should *left*-justify, rather than *justify*. (apple.com does this, for example)
  - General admin:
    - [ ] Make this `README.md` nice for public repo viewing

Fix if can:
  - [ ] Hero image gets squished once width gets too small...
    - [ ] Change the files in the `<picture>` for small enough screen size. No "cropped", or better cropping.
  - [ ] Make sidenotes appear as a pop up on tapping the link when too small
        - ^^ like wikipedia hovering over internal links
  - [ ] When hovering over navbar links, the text transitions through *gray*. 
    - Could change from "black --> white" to "(very dark blue) --> white"



# SECTION: ON SUBMIT:
  - [ ] `git checkout -b submission-branch`; `git push --set-upstream origin submission-branch`
  - `suggestions.html`:
    - [ ] Change the "TODO:" message on submit to a "yay that worked!" message
  - JS:
    - [ ] Merge them all into one horrible monster `.js` file
  - Write `Readme.md` file to explain folder setup
